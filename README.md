## **Professional Summary**

I am a physicist with a Ph.D. in Statistical Mechanics from the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC),
where I also earned my M.Sc. (2009) and B.Sc. (2006) degrees in Physics.
I have over ten years of experience teaching Physics at the university level, having worked at UFSC, the State University of Santa Catarina (UDESC),
and the Federal University of Fronteira Sul (UFFS).

My research area is Statistical Mechanics, with an emphasis on phase transitions and critical phenomena.
Throughout my academic career, I have studied several disordered and aperiodic magnetic models,
gaining experience in both theoretical and computational methods such as Monte Carlo simulations, mean-field, and effective-field approximations.
I have published five peer-reviewed papers in international journals, including Physica A, Physica B, and Physical Review E.

In recent years, I have expanded my work into Data Science and Machine Learning, with experience in computational modeling,
data analysis, and the development of numerical simulations and pipelines applied to the energy sector.
I am proficient in Python, statistics, and data visualization, with a strong interest in transforming complex data into meaningful insights to support decision-making.
