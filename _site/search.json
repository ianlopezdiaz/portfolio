(2009) and B.Sc. (2006) degrees in Physics. I have over ten years of experience teaching Physics at the university level, having worked at UFSC, UDESC, and UFFS.\nMy research area is Statistical Mechanics, with an emphasis on phase transitions and critical phenomena. Throughout my academic career, I have studied several disordered and aperiodic magnetic models, gaining experience in both theoretical and computational methods such as Monte Carlo simulations, mean-field, and effective-field approximations. I have published five peer-reviewed papers in international journals, including Physica A, Physica B, and Physical Review E.\nIn recent years, I have expanded my work into Data Science and Machine Learning, with experience in computational modeling, data analysis, and the development of numerical simulations and pipelines applied to the energy sector.\nCVs: English | Portuguese\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneTechnical Skills\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramming: Python, C/C++, R, SQL\nModeling: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Statsmodels\nVisualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly\nDatabases: MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL\nOther: Git, Linux, LaTeX, Monte Carlo Simulations, Feature Engineering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneExperience\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Scientist / Data Analyst – Lima Brain Technology (2022–2023)\n\nDesigned and implemented data pipelines for the ENIA project (EDP).\n\nSimulation Developer / Data Scientist – Lima Brain Technology (2021–2024)\n\nDeveloped Monte Carlo simulations and numerical algorithms for the ANGRA project, integrating physical modeling and data science.\n\nPhysics Lecturer (2008–2025)\n\nUFSC, Florianópolis, SC, Brazil: 08/2008–07/2010; 02/2013–12/2014; 02/2018–12/2019; 08/2023–07/2025\nUDESC, Ibirama, SC, Brazil: 02/2020–07/2022\nUFFS, Cerro Largo, RS, Brazil: 01/2011–02/2013\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneEducation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPh.D. in Physics (Statistical Mechanics) – UFSC, 2015–2017\nM.Sc. in Physics (Statistical Mechanics) – UFSC, 2007–2009\nB.Sc. in Physics – UFSC, 2003–2006\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneProjects\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple GitHub Page generated from Jupyter Notebooks – Using Quarto\nAnother project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonePeer-Reviewed Publications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompensation temperature in spin-1/2 Ising trilayers: A Monte Carlo study.
